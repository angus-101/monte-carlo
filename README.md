# monte-carlo
3rd year computational physics module

This exercise investigated the use of random numbers in Monte Carlo techniques.

This involved generating distributions using both the analytical and accept/reject method, and comparing their accuracy and cpu time. 

This was then used to simulate a cosmic ray experiment, in which cosmic muons pass through several detectors, each with varying efficiencies.
